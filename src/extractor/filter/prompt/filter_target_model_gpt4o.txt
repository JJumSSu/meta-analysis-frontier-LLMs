Check if the provided Table LaTeX includes numerical experimental results for the target model, specifically considering its versions across different time periods (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-0828, GPT-4o-0623, GPT-4o-0314). 
Tables should be regarded as containing results for the target model if they include these versions. However, if the table only includes variant models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4V, GPT4-Turbo, or o1), consider the table as not containing results for the target model.
Respond with 'true' if the table contains results for the target model, and 'false' otherwise, with no additional explanation.
