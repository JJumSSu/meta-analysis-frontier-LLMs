This repository contains the code for (1) extracting experimental data related to target LLMs from arXiv sources (constructing LLMEvalDB), and (2) analyzing the extracted data, [LLMEvalDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jungsoopark/LLMEvalDB), as presented in our paper [Can LLMs Help Uncover Insights about LLMs? 
A Large-Scale, Evolving Literature Analysis of Frontier LLMs
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18791).
